# PG-DBDA_Project_Work

We have implemented 'NLP-Based Fake News Detector' model which is able to predict fake or genuine news articles using Natural Language Processing techniques. We have used collection of datasets of news articles, preprocessing the text which includes tokenization, lemmatization and removing stopwords technique, extracting relevant features, training a machine learning model to detect real or fake articles based on their content. NLP techniques such as text classification, word cloud to achieve high accuracy among the fake or real news articles. Utilized python programming and NLTK. Worked on different models and evaluate the performance.
