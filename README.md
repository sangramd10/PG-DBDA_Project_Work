We have implemented 'Fake News Detection Using Natural Language Processing(NLP) Techniques' model which is able to predict fake or genuine news articles using NLP techniques. We have used collection of datasets of news articles,preprocessing the text which includes tokenization technique,extracting relevant features,train the model to detect real or fake articles based on their content.
NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis,text classification and BERT  to achieve high accuracy among the fake or real news articles. We have worked on different models and evaluate the performance
